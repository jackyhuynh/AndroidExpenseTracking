## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Android Studio: Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.
- Android Studio Emulator: Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Googleâ€™s Android operating system, built on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools (ADT) as primary IDE for native Android application development.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.
Download and Install Android Studio and Android Studio Emulator (unless you want to test it with your own devices, you don't have to download it)
* [Android Studio Emulator](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) - If you don't have an Android device available to test with, we recommend using the default emulator that comes with Android Studio. If you run into any problems setting it up, follow the steps in this guide.
Download and Install Android Studio IDE:
* [Install Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio) - Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device.

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
